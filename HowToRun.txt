How To Run


To run the .jar, type at the command line from the same directory as Snake.jar: 

	java -jar --module-path "C:\Users\userName\javafx-sdk-11.0.2\lib" --add-modules javafx.controls,javafx.fxml snake.jar 
		-the above path should just be the path to the javafx library on your computer.  

	  
Known bugs: 

	If you enter a save file name and restart the game, the program will save the parts of the game before the reset.  This means that after every reset, the file name 
	for logging the save needs to be re entered, or else the save file will contain the old game up to the reset.  

	The data is logged as a growing string, so it would be more efficient to instead append the lines directly to a txt file. This bug could be significant if there are
	many game instances running at once, like when implementing a gentic algorithm.  

	if the settings at the top of a saved file are corrupted, then the game will be unable to replay that log.  The top should include two one integer codes followed by 
	hex rgb color codes, ex: 2-1-0xcce6ffff-0x804d80ff-0xff0000ff.
